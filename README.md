# CarpoolApp 🚗 (Learning Project)

Welcome to my Carpool App! This is a personal side project I am building in my free time to learn and master iOS development using Swift and SwiftUI. 

The goal of this project isn't to launch the next Uber, but rather to deeply understand modern iOS architecture, UI/UX implementation, and Apple's native frameworks.

🎨 **UI/UX Design:** I believe great apps start with great design. Before writing any code, I designed the user flows and interface. You can check out my design work here:

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
Through this project, I am actively learning and applying:
* **SwiftUI:** Building declarative, responsive, and modern user interfaces.
* **Architecture:** Implementing a clean MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to separate logic from UI.
* **Project Organization:** Structuring an Xcode project by feature (Features, Core, Models, Services) rather than just dumping files in one place.
* **Apple Frameworks:** Exploring tools like `MapKit` for routing and `CoreLocation` for tracking user coordinates.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Swift
* **UI Framework:** SwiftUI
* **Environment:** Xcode 15+ / iOS 17+

## 🚧 Current Status
*Work in Progress.* Since this is a passion project built during my evenings and weekends, features are being added incrementally. The codebase represents my current understanding of Swift, and I am always refactoring as I learn better ways to do things!

## 🤝 Feedback Welcome
If you are a more experienced iOS developer looking at this repo, I would absolutely love constructive feedback on my code, architecture, or SwiftUI usage. Feel free to open an issue or drop a comment!
